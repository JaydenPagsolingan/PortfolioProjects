# Project Summary: Culture Shock Dance Studio Data Analysis in Excel
## Overview
I was getting more into data analysis (playing with pivot tables and dashboards) when I thought, "Wouldn't it be really cool to do data analysis on dance?" Dance is my first and biggest passion
so I thought it should serve the basis of my first project. I was working my shift at the studio and asked one of the managers on duty for data to practice analyzing. And wouldn't you know it, she said sure!
