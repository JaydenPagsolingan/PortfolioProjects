# Project Summary: Culture Shock Dance Studio Data Analysis in Excel

## Context
I was getting more into data analysis (playing with pivot tables and dashboards) when I thought, "Wouldn't it be really cool to do data analysis on dance?" Dance is my first and biggest passion
so I thought it should serve as the basis for my first project. 

One day during my shift at Culture Shock Dance Studio, I asked one of the managers for data to practice analyzing. And wouldn't you know it, she said sure!

I was handed 2 months worth of client data to work with given the following objectives...

## Objectives
- What days of the week have the most popular classes?
- What classes bring in the most money?
- Which instructors have the most clients?
- Any other insights?

## Techniques
Data Cleaning
- Separated Sub Instructors from Regular Instructors
- Handled inconsistent, incorrect, and irrelevant data
- Converted data types
- Data standardization

Data Exploration
- Descriptive analysis
- Univariate analysis
- Time series analysis

Data Visualization
- Visualized my findings using pivot charts in a dashboard
- Suggested 3 questions for the manager's consideration

## Thought Process and What I Learned
This was my first ever full data analysis project using real data ... so I was definitely excited and confused.

The first hurdle I had to solve was figuring out how to calculate how much money each client paid since the studio has different packages. I like to communicate with people if I'm stuck, so I asked my manager how the studio's package system worked and eventually included only the rows I needed. 

This biggest time consumer was cleaning up the instructors column. I wanted to find which instructors get paid the most, but having sub instructors in the mix skews the data.
So, I ended up separating sub instructors into a different column. I tried using V-LOOKUP functions to separate regulars from subs, but I kept getting errors in my formulas.
I instead realized it would be much easier to just go through the data manually since it's only 2 months of data (it just took a couple sittings).

The second biggest thing I learned was to always have my client in mind while analyzing the data. I ended up going down the rabbit hole of analyzing data that wasn't useful at all to my manager; this wasted so much time. However, I eventually got the visualizations and insights I wanted and displayed everything I felt was important and insightful into a dashboard.

Overall, the process was super messy, but I always enjoyed learning and overcoming every obstacle.
